# Academic project

In this repository you will find the jupiter notebook with all the code, a project report and slides with detailed explanations of the project and of our results.

The goal of this project was to implement Unsupervised Data Augmentation on a custom MNIST dataset (with only 100 labeled images and 59,900 unlabeled images). We achieved a final 97% accuracy on the test dataset.

This project was done by LÃ©os Coutrot, Jaad Belhouari and Luc Yao.
